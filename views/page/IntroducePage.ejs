                    <li>Our research interest covers developing various computational tools for solving biological problems. <br>The research ranges from construction of mathematical/statistical algorithms to solve various problems in biological data analysis including molecular omics data sets and in silico modeling.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The aims of the research are 1) identifying molecular signatures for disease diagnosis and treatment, and 2) developing framework for personalized medicine that proposes the customization of healthcare to the individual patient by use of each patient’s unique life profile in terms of genetic, phenotypic and environmental factors.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>he aim of personalized medicine is not only to develop patient-specific drugs based on the differences among individuals, but also to personalize treatment in order to account for patient differences in disease development and drug response.</li>
