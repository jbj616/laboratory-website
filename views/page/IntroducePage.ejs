                    <li >Bio and medical informatics are an emerging research fields that are a interdisciplinary study focusing on massive and complex information on biology (molecules, tissues, and cells) and medical (prescription, symptom, and health examination) knowledge</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Our research interest covers developing various computational tools for solving biological and medical problems. The research ranges from construction of artificial intelligence-based model to solve various problems in biological and medical data analysis including molecular data, EMR data, public health data and Korean medicine knowledge. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The aims of the research are 1) developing AI-based models for personalized medicine that help healthcare of patients by utilizing various types of patientâ€™s information, including genetic, phenotypic and environmental factors, and 2) identifying molecular signatures for disease diagnosis and treatment.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The aim of personalized medicine is not only to develop patient-specific drugs based on the differences among individuals, but also to personalize treatment in order to account for patient differences in disease development and drug response.</li>
